                <p>Catchy! To call this song youthful would be an understatement.
                The hand claps as percussion go a long way in creating the atmosphere of this being performed at a live event, where the scene of the song would occur. 
                Likewise, since this first album of theirs is all the catalog they had from doing live shows, it was probably a scene the band had seen many times. 
                The song certainly isn’t sonically complex, but leading off their debut with an original instead of the covers is pretty savvy!</p>

                <p>The piano section in this is beautiful, if not remarkable.
                Sticks to its youthful guns, saying nothing particular but universally applicable.
                The juxtaposition of the content and the chords doesn't work as well after a couple of listens.
                Lennon and McCartney are credited as the songwriters, though I'm inferring the tone of the lyrics is leaning towards Lennon.
                He was always supposed to be the more 'ironic' writer.</p>

                It's in line with my preferences, but Lennon's scratchy vocals are gorgeous.

                <p>After a run of covers, we're back to the dynamic duo of McCartney and Lennon.
                Though this song doesn't have quite the punch, it certainly has some highlights.
                This song has the BEST fadeout on the album.
                I'm definitely displaying a bias towards Lennon's vocals. They're just so heavenly.
                Can't get as much play as a single because of its mellower demeanor but I prefer it to 'Misery'.
                To which this song is definitely sisters, as its delivery of the line "I can't conceive of any more misery".
                Given this album's role is to introduce the raw potential of the quintet, this is a high-point of the group's budding lyrical prowess.</p>

                Lennon and his harmonica—I know Bushwick would spit you out with some excellent scratchy tattoos.
                The picking on the electric guitar is pretty impressive, really balances out the surf rock aesthetic.
                McCartney and Lennon are out in full force with their duets here, especially the raspy "Come on's" of Lennon.
                Ringo showing out on the drums here as well.

                The highest gear the band has vocally at this stage in their discography is when McCartney is singing somber and sultry.
                Lennon's backup vocals on this song are mixed terribly! So jarring to just have him come in so strong on single words.
                This song owes a lot to the Blues. McCartney in particular, I imagine doing the Elvis pose when he sings "You know I want you to".
                At this point in the album, I am sick of hearing the word love.
                I don't think they knew how to end this song.</p>

                Harrison and McCartney's background harmonies on this joint are divine.
                It's of legend at this point that this album was recorded in a day, but it really comes through that Lennon is pulling his voice for the finale.</p>

                <p>Harrison isn't bad on this track but he really struggles to hold a note.
                There are some times he definitely comes up flat as well.
                The mixing on McCartney and Lennon's backup harmonies makes them sound so ghostly.
                The strumming intro to this song is absolutely a high point of the album sonically.
                For an album that at times is really cookie cutter, and this song especially, those sonic moments were true flashes of brilliance.
                For being an original, this is probably their most daring attempt at lyrics for a love song on the album.</p>

                <p>This song is immortalized as a cover so excellent it becomes the reference for the song, surpassing the original.
                Lennon sounds like his larynx is against the edge of wire and it's so sexy.
                High point of this song is absolutely the four-part harmony they pull off twice!
                That's how you end an album! The instrumentation is so celebratory and final.
                Enough can't be said about Lennon's vocals on this track—rolled across gravel and the distance of the bar to ask for a dance.
                Their little shouts are just captivating. They were having so much fun!</p>

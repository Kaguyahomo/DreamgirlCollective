            <p class="content-text">I am grabbing the bones under my eyes
Thinking about girls that will leave me
I will exist in a time and place
And there is no album to listen to that will inhibit this
What would it mean to break it between my fingers
To accept responsibility
I will run the wheels bald
I will change very little in my life to address my concerns 
There is a moment
In which the other shoe will drop
How long can I escape
How long can I exist on borrowed time
Is what I have to do violent
Must I find resolution in catharsis 
No one will be listening and I will exist 
No one will be reading and these words will be here
Women are obsessed with using mediums to transcend
And it will never happen
Do you feel your mystery fade?
Do you feel yourself become a commodity?
Do you feel like a lover of mine?
Is your art sold?
Are your heads filled with flames? 
I will drive to produce a piece of consistent art
I will attempt a narrative
Aren't we all going for meaning?
Tomatoes and radiowire
Flavor and apartment fires
Feel your life determined
Sucked into process that exist above you
Fight against it with liberal fervor
Praise the world as it exists in your fetishized mind
Exist as a subject 
Grafittit hate speech in your grad student lounge
Won't you rock out with your cock out
Does injecting estrogen make you a woman
Are you annoyed at with the sheer volume of questiome
I suppose it's all semantics sweetheart </p>

        <h2>Quotes</h2>
        <p>
            "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing." – Edmund Burke<br>
            "It is not our differences that divide us. It is our inability to recognize, accept, and celebrate those differences." – Audre Lorde<br>
            "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere." – Martin Luther King Jr.
        </p>

        <h2>Theoretical Justification</h2>
        <p>
            The digital library concept is rooted in theories of democratized access to information. The theoretical justification for creating digital libraries is to provide access to knowledge and culture without the limitations of physical space and traditional publishing barriers.
            By offering a vast array of resources to a global audience, digital libraries serve as tools for education, research, and cultural preservation. They enable users to engage with information in new ways, fostering collaboration, innovation, and intellectual growth.
        </p>

        <h2>Storage</h2>
        <p>
            A digital library relies heavily on storage infrastructure. Digital content is stored on servers in data centers, with backups and redundancy systems in place to ensure data integrity. Cloud storage solutions offer scalability, allowing the library to grow as more resources are digitized. Additionally, metadata plays a crucial role in organizing and retrieving information efficiently.

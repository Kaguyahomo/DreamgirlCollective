            <p class="content-text">Throwing my life away on these fucking screens.
                Trying to jam my head full in fear of everything I won't know.
                Got to assume it was just the way I was raised.
                Because I've held secret to me this false sense of superiority my whole goddamn life
                I can only now know it's this false sense when I finally built up the courage to talk to others.
                Though I'm confident if you ask anyone who's even a little familiar,
                this smugness simply oozes out of my skin.
                Everytime I meet or read about someone actually talented,
                actually driven, 
                actually kind,
                I am overcome by melancholy and impressive self-hatred.
                When you're alone its much harder to pass it over to the girl who cares about you.
                Crying is apart of being alone. 
                Maybe I just shouldn't be alone but, 
                When will that help me to see outside myself?
                When will that help me feel self-satisfaction that I can believe I've earned?
                Sunglasses on the porch so the housekeeper won't see me cry.
                Taking my talents to the ruling class.
                I miss drinking from youth.
                At least I gained the luxury of not rmemebeing those time, at least in any tangible way.
                I've run out of steam to be vulnerable for any second longer.
